abstract="At present, with the development of mobile applications from the simple calls to data transmission, the contents of mobile applications have become colorful and the requirements to the mobile software will be higher and higher. Especially, as a consequence of the progressive integration between the wireless and wire-line environments, the need of deploying distributed applications such as multi-Agent systems on handheld devices is becoming more and more important. This implementation will make mobile applications more intelligent and proactive but it is very complicated. In this article, Jade-Leap add-on was used to solve the integration of Jade and Android platform. As an example, one Jade Agent for retrieving train running information was successfully developed on Android platform. During the course of research, some problems, such as the communication among Jade Agents, the interactions between Jade Agent and Android Activity, the interactions among Android Activities and so on were addressed and then solved. The application of Agent into mobile platform will make mobile services more intelligent, proactive and interactive, which will meet the personalized needs of mobile phone users.",
