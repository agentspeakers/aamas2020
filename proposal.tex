We propose the revise the plan model typically adopted in PR agents / BDI to:

\begin{itemize}

\item enforce goal/task orientation, that is:
%
every plan $p$ has an explicit account for the task $t$ to be either achieved or maintained.
%
The unique invoking condition is always a goal/task to be achieved or maintained.
%
This implies that every intention at runtime -- as a plan in execution -- as an a

\item extend the body to include also reactive behaviours, besides compositions of actions and subgoals. 
%
This is meant to improve  the modularity/encapsulation of plans.

\end{itemize}
